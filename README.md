This is my submission for the Maze Assignment in Introduction to Video Gaming in the Dawson Indie Video Game Design Program. Fall 2025.

Everything in this project except for the music was made by me, Darcy Mazloum. We can thank Mozart for the background music.

Control the character with WASD and use your mouse click to open some doors.

No bugs that I know of.

There are three kinds of trigger zones which activate animations.
(1) There are three maze entrances in the "Hub World" which open when the player is inside of an invisible zone next to the door AND the player mouse clicks on that zone (this is the finnicky door).
(2) The end of the maze has a transparent rectangular prism which lifts up to reveal the key when you approach an invisible zone in front of it. It opens and closes as you enter and exit the zone. Try it!
(3) When you collect all of the keys from the mazes the final door will open ONLY AFTER you approach the door and move through the carpet in front of it.

The maze itself is instantiated every time you play the game. In fact, three new mazes are randomly generated each time you start a new game. Makes everything a bit more replayable n'est-ce pas?

I hope you enjoy the game!
